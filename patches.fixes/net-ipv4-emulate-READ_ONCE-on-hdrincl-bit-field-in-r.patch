Subject: net: ipv4: emulate READ_ONCE() on ->hdrincl bit-field in raw_sendmsg()
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc8
Git-commit: 20b50d79974ea3192e8c3ab7faf4e536e5f14d8f
References: CVE-2017-17712 bsc#1073229

Commit 8f659a03a0ba ("net: ipv4: fix for a race condition in
raw_sendmsg") fixed the issue of possibly inconsistent ->hdrincl handling
due to concurrent updates by reading this bit-field member into a local
variable and using the thus stabilized value in subsequent tests.

However, aforementioned commit also adds the (correct) comment that

  /* hdrincl should be READ_ONCE(inet->hdrincl)
   * but READ_ONCE() doesn't work with bit fields
   */

because as it stands, the compiler is free to shortcut or even eliminate
the local variable at its will.

Note that I have not seen anything like this happening in reality and thus,
the concern is a theoretical one.

However, in order to be on the safe side, emulate a READ_ONCE() on the
bit-field by doing it on the local 'hdrincl' variable itself:

	int hdrincl = inet->hdrincl;
	hdrincl = READ_ONCE(hdrincl);

This breaks the chain in the sense that the compiler is not allowed
to replace subsequent reads from hdrincl with reloads from inet->hdrincl.
