Subject: l2tp: fix use-after-free during module unload
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc7
Git-commit: 2f86953e7436c9b9a4690909c5e2db24799e173b
References: bsc#1042286

Tunnel deletion is delayed by both a workqueue (l2tp_tunnel_delete -> wq
 -> l2tp_tunnel_del_work) and RCU (sk_destruct -> RCU ->
l2tp_tunnel_destruct).

By the time l2tp_tunnel_destruct() runs to destroy the tunnel and finish
destroying the socket, the private data reserved via the net_generic
mechanism has already been freed, but l2tp_tunnel_destruct() actually
uses this data.

Make sure tunnel deletion for the netns has completed before returning
from l2tp_exit_net() by first flushing the tunnel removal workqueue, and
then waiting for RCU callbacks to complete.

Fixes: 167eb17e0b17 ("l2tp: create tunnel sockets in the right namespace")
