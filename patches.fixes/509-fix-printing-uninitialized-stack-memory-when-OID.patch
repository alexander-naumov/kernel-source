Subject: [PATCH] 509: fix printing uninitialized stack memory when OID is
 empty

References: bsc#1075078
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc3
Git-commit: 8dfd2f22d3bf3ab7714f7495ad5d897b8845e8c1

Callers of sprint_oid() do not check its return value before printing
the result.  In the case where the OID is zero-length, -EBADMSG was
being returned without anything being written to the buffer, resulting
in uninitialized stack memory being printed.  Fix this by writing
"(bad)" to the buffer in the cases where -EBADMSG is returned.

Fixes: 4f73175d0375 ("X.509: Add utility functions to render OIDs as strings")
