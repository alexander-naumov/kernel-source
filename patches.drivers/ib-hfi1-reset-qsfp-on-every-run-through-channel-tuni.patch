Subject: IB/hfi1: Reset QSFP on every run through channel tuning
Git-commit: b5e710195492f682d93097cddac13e594d39a946
Patch-mainline: v4.8
References: git-fixes
Acked-by: Jiri Bohac <jbohac@suse.cz>

Active QSFP cables were reset only every alternate iteration of the
channel tuning algorithm instead of every iteration due to incorrect
reset of the flag that controlled QSFP reset, resulting in using stale
QSFP status in the channel tuning algorithm.

Fixes: 8ebd4cf1852a ("Add active and optical cable support")
