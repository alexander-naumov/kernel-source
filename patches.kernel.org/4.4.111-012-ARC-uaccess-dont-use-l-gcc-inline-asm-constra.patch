Subject: [PATCH] ARC: uaccess: dont use "l" gcc inline asm constraint modifier
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.111
Git-commit: 79435ac78d160e4c245544d457850a56f805ac0d

commit 79435ac78d160e4c245544d457850a56f805ac0d upstream.

This used to setup the LP_COUNT register automatically, but now has been
removed.

There was an earlier fix 3c7c7a2fc8811 which fixed instance in delay.h but
somehow missed this one as gcc change had not made its way into
production toolchains and was not pedantic as it is now !
