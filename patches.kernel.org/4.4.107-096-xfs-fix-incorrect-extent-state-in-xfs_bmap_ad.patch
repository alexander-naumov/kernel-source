Subject: [PATCH] xfs: fix incorrect extent state in
 xfs_bmap_add_extent_unwritten_real
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.107
Git-commit: 5e422f5e4fd71d18bc6b851eeb3864477b3d842e

[ Upstream commit 5e422f5e4fd71d18bc6b851eeb3864477b3d842e ]

There was one spot in xfs_bmap_add_extent_unwritten_real that didn't use the
passed in new extent state but always converted to normal, leading to wrong
behavior when converting from normal to unwritten.

Only found by code inspection, it seems like this code path to move partial
extent from written to unwritten while merging it with the next extent is
rarely exercised.
