Subject: [PATCH] vhost_net: stop device during reset owner
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.116
Git-commit: 4cd879515d686849eec5f718aeac62a70b067d82

[ Upstream commit 4cd879515d686849eec5f718aeac62a70b067d82 ]

We don't stop device before reset owner, this means we could try to
serve any virtqueue kick before reset dev->worker. This will result a
warn since the work was pending at llist during owner resetting. Fix
this by stopping device during owner reset.
