Subject: [PATCH] afs: Fix the maths in afs_fs_store_data()
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.107
Git-commit: 146a1192783697810b63a1e41c4d59fc93387340

[ Upstream commit 146a1192783697810b63a1e41c4d59fc93387340 ]

afs_fs_store_data() works out of the size of the write it's going to make,
but it uses 32-bit unsigned subtraction in one place that gets
automatically cast to loff_t.

However, if to < offset, then the number goes negative, but as the result
isn't signed, this doesn't get sign-extended to 64-bits when placed in a
loff_t.

Fix by casting the operands to loff_t.
