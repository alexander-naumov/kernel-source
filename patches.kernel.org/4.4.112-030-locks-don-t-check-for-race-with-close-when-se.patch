Subject: [PATCH] locks: don't check for race with close when setting OFD lock
Patch-mainline: 4.4.112
References: -- FS bnc#1012382 lock performance
Git-commit: 0752ba807b04ccd69cb4bc8bbf829a80ee208a3c

commit 0752ba807b04ccd69cb4bc8bbf829a80ee208a3c upstream.

We don't clean out OFD locks on close(), so there's no need to check
for a race with them here. They'll get cleaned out at the same time
that flock locks are.
