Subject: [PATCH] bcache: silence static checker warning
Git-commit: da22f0eea555baf9b0a84b52afe56db2052cfe8d
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: bsc#1076110

In olden times, closure_return() used to have a hidden return built in.
We removed the hidden return but forgot to add a new return here.  If
"c" were NULL we would oops on the next line, but fortunately "c" is
never NULL.  Let's just remove the if statement.
